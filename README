Code is done in python 3.7.3
In the "workdir" directory exec.sh and build.sh files are stored. Althought build.sh is empty as it is not needed to run python code.

For lexical analysis PLY is used.
The exec.sh file should be run as follows...

./exec.sh <input_file>
Absolute path should be used at all times for the input files.
